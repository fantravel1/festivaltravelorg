      <h2>Finding Female‑Friendly Hotels</h2>
      <p>Choosing the right accommodation is key to feeling safe and comfortable on your travels. Here are our top tips for finding female‑friendly hotels:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rely on personal communities, trusted influencers, friends and independent reviews – they’re often more reliable than marketing.</li>
        <li>Look for essential safety features such as a 24×7 manned reception, double‑locking doors, a well‑lit approach and a good neighbourhood.</li>
        <li>Opt for hotels that offer spy holes and place solo women in secure areas of the building.</li>
        <li>Comfort matters too: full‑length mirrors, plug sockets near mirrors, decent hair‑dryers, removable coat hangers and luxury bathroom products can make your stay pleasant.</li>
        <li>Some properties offer women‑only floors – for example, the Four Seasons in Riyadh has a dedicated Pearl Floor for lone female travellers.</li>
      </ul>
