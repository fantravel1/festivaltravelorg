      <h2>Festival Safety Tips</h2>
      <p>Following tried‑and‑tested advice can make your festival experience safer and more enjoyable. Here are our top recommendations for attending festivals on your own or with friends:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Introduce yourself to neighbours in the campsite and look out for each other’s tents.</li>
        <li>Learn the route to toilets, water points and the arena during daylight so you can find your way after dark.</li>
        <li>Look after yourself by staying hydrated and applying sunscreen even when it’s cloudy.</li>
        <li>Charge your phone daily and carry pre‑charged battery packs for emergencies.</li>
        <li>Walk confidently when alone; looking like you know where you’re going can deter unwanted attention.</li>
        <li>Guard your drinks: never leave them unattended or accept drinks from strangers; scrunchie covers can prevent drink spiking.</li>
        <li>Chat to people around you in the crowd so someone has your back if things get rough.</li>
        <li>If you feel uncomfortable, head to the nearest information point or zone hub where staff are available 24/7 to help.</li>
        <li>Report suspicious behaviour to festival staff – you can do this anonymously if you prefer.</li>
        <li>Make friends via community groups before the event or volunteer to benefit from secure campsites and support networks.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Nightlife &amp; Party Safety</h2>
      <p>Whether you’re dancing at a festival after party or exploring nightlife in a new city, these tips help you stay safe while having fun:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Share your location and tell your friends where you’re going and with whom; never leave without letting them know.</li>
        <li>Treat your drink like an accessory: keep it in sight at all times and never finish a drink if you didn’t see it prepared.</li>
        <li>Know your limits and pace yourself with water between alcoholic drinks.</li>
        <li>Be a good bystander – speak up and alert security if you see suspicious behaviour.</li>
        <li>Prevent overdoses by testing substances when possible and carrying Naloxone; seek help from staff if someone is in trouble.</li>
        <li>Practise safe sex: ensure consent, use protection and get tested regularly.</li>
        <li>Keep your phone charged and carry a portable charger to stay connected and get home safely.</li>
        <li>Verify rideshare vehicles by checking licence plates and asking who they’re picking up; don’t put an intoxicated friend in a car alone.</li>
        <li>Plan your night as a group and stick together; share names if going off with new people.</li>
        <li>Stay aware, trust your intuition and know where exits and bouncers are; leave if you feel unsafe.</li>
      </ul>
